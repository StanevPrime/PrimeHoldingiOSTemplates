# Description
With Prime Holding's templates you can create ViewModels with easy.

# Create new ViewModel

* There are situations when you have view controller but it's too complex and you need to have more than one view models. In those situations you can create a ViewModels and later on to associate it with the existing View Controller.

* The template ViewModel faciliates creation as following:


![Alt text](Images/Step16.png?raw=true "Step 16")
![Alt text](Images/Step17.png?raw=true "Step 17")

* So that the following ViewModel will be created
![Alt text](Images/Step12.png?raw=true "Step 12")


* Add the files into DI

 1. You should **manually** add the ViewModel you have created in ViewModelAssembly so DI can resolve it when needed
 ![Alt text](Images/Step14.png?raw=true "Step 14")
